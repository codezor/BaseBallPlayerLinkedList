# BaseBallPlayerLinkedList
This projects a class project for my Data Structures class. The Baseball roster has two data structures classes in it one the Player class used to create a data structure for an individual baseball player and the PlayerList Class that stores a list of players in a Linked List. The main file reads in a text file with the player class and the PlayerList class sorts it into an ordered linked list.
